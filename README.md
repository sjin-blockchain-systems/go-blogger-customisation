# go-blogger

Go Blogger: A simple &amp; lightweight backend for developers' personal blogs.

Bloggy started as a small side-project for an own dev blog
but you can use it too.
You can find API documentation in [openapi](api/openapi.yaml) config file.

All it does is serving posts from DB and providing a simple API to manage them;
subscribing readers to that blog and sending email notifications via Mailjet.
